# Half-Duplex UDP Client–Server Demo

A minimal Python example demonstrating a half-duplex UDP “chat” between a sender (client) and a receiver (server). The sender reads user input, sends it to the server, and waits for a reply. Typing `0` cleanly shuts down both sides.

## Project Overview

This repo contains two Python scripts:

- **receiver.py** – Binds to a UDP port, echoes incoming messages back in uppercase, and terminates on receiving the `exit` command.  
- **sender.py** – Reads user input, sends it via UDP to the server, prints server responses, and exits on `exit`.  

Together they illustrate a simple half-duplex exchange over UDP.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or newer  
- No external libraries required  

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmad-rami-bit/udp-half-duplex-demo.git
   cd udp-half-duplex-demo
   ```  
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # on Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat      # on Windows
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

1. In one terminal window, start the UDP receiver:  
   ```bash
   python receiver.py
   ```  
2. The server will bind to port `1234` by default and wait for messages.

### Running the Client

1. In another terminal window, start the UDP sender:  
   ```bash
   python sender.py
   ```  
2. Enter any text and press Enter. The server will echo it back in uppercase.  
3. To terminate the session, type `exit` and press Enter. Both client and server will close gracefully.

## Configuration

You can customize host, port, and terminator values at the top of each script:

| Variable         | Default    | Description                           |
|------------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| `SERVER_HOST`    | localhost  | Hostname or IP of the UDP server      |
| `SERVER_PORT`    | 1234       | UDP port number for both client/server|
| `BUFFER_SIZE`    | 2048       | Maximum bytes per UDP message         |
| `TERMINATOR`     | exit (0)   | Command string to shut down scripts   |
